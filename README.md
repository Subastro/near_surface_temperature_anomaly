# Global Near-Surface Temperature Anomalies (Yearly Trends)

This project presents a visualization of global near-surface temperature anomalies from 1850 to 2025. The graph includes upper bound, lower bound, and average yearly temperature deviations in degrees Celsius.

# Description

- **Red Line**: Average yearly temperature anomaly
- **Blue Line**: Lower bound of estimates
- **Gray Line**: Upper bound of estimates
- **X-Axis**: Year (1850–2025)
- **Y-Axis**: Temperature anomaly in °C

 # Data Source

The data used in this visualization was sourced from:
- **Our World in Data** = [https://ourworldindata.org   ](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)


# Result
- From 1850 to around 1975, anomalies fluctuate near zero.
- After 1975, the graph shows a strong upward trend, indicating accelerating global warming, especially after 2000.
- By 2023–2025, anomalies exceed 1.5 °C, highlighting critical global warming thresholds.

# Usage
This visualization can be used to understand the historical global warming trend.
